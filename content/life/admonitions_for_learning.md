<p><em>
It doesn't matter. It doesn't because you don't need them. They're not gonna give it to you? So What? You're gonna take it. You're gonna do whatever it takes. You're not gonna play by the rules. You're gonna go your own way. You're gonna do what they won't do. You're gonna be smart. You're gonna cut corners. And you are gonna win. They're on the 35th floor? You're gonna be on the 50th floor. You're gonna be looking down on them. And the higher you rise, the more they're gonna hate you. Good, you rub their noses in it. You make them suffer. You don't matter all that much to them. So what? Screw them. Remember, the winner takes it all.
